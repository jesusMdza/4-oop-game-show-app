Project: OOP Game Show Application

Vanilla JS

In this project, I was required to implement OOP to create a game.
This game, "Phrase Hunter", works by displaying a list
of blocks which each represent a letter. Each letter is hidden and 
combine to create a phrase. The user has to guess what that phrase is.
User is given 5 lives.

When clicking "start game", a new game is created.
User's letter input is checked for. If their letter is included in
the current phrase, that specific letter block is displayed. 
If it's not in the current phrase, the user loses a life.
User cannot input the same letter during current game.

For extra credit, styles were applied to the game which 
are noted below. 
I also gave the user the ability to use their physical keyboard to
guess.
